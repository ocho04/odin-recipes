    <h2>Decription</h2>
        <p>Use this cheese pizza recipe as a template, 
            and vary the cheeses and vegetables to make 
            your own creations. </p>
            
        <p>Allow the pizza to stand 
            five minutes before slicing to allow any liquid 
            on top time to be reabsorbed into the toppings 
            so the crust won't get soggy</p>

    <h2>Ingrdients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 (8-ounce) package presliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 cup marinara sauce</li>
            <li>¾ cup sliced bottled roasted red bell peppers</li>
            <li>½ cup (2 ounces) shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 500°</li>
            <li>Heat 2 teaspoons olive oil 
                in a large nonstick skillet 
                over medium-high heat. Add black pepper, 
                minced garlic, and mushrooms; sauté for 
                5 minutes or until mushrooms are tender 
                and most of liquid evaporates.</li>
            <li>Spread sauce over the pizza crust, 
                leaving a 1/2-inch border, and top with mushroom 
                mixture. Sprinkle evenly with mozzarella. 
                Top with roasted red bell peppers. 
                Bake at 500° for 10 minutes or until cheese melts 
                and begins to brown. Let pizza stand for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 500°</li>
        </ol>
